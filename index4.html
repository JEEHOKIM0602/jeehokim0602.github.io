            <p id="response">In “Ways of Seeing,” I think John Berger gives us an opportunity to new ways of seeing not only the artworks but also everything around us. Through four episodes, 
                he criticizes old methods known as ways to appreciate past works of art, arguing that they are wrong and narrow-minded. He argues that the impressions or images now we have in particular 
                artworks are maybe re-created or re-produced views, as the standard we appreciate a particular artwork, such as aesthetic value, truth and the artist’s intention, may actually be the way 
                it was learned by certain ruling classes to mystify the artworks they owned. Also, with the example of sunset in evening, he also delivers his idea that the relation between what we see and 
                what we know is never settled, and that we should look artworks in many ways, not just in one.
