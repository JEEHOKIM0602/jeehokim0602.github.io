            As the Web developed from 1 to 3, there were some changes in the method of how to use them. <br>
            Web 1, the earliest stage, provided only a level of service that collects offline information <br> 
            around the world so that users could find it digitally. However, in Web 2, users were able to <br>
            access other usersâ€™ information and share their information with others. <br>
            And now, Web 3 allows users to access, upload and share information, as well as consider <br>
            their personal information as assets. NFT is a digital token that uses blockchain technology <br> 
            to protect individual assets in digital space. In other words, with NFT, Web 3 users are able to <br> 
            maintain the value of their original works and their uniquenesses. As time changes and <br>
            technology develops, various forms and methods are emerging in art. If digital arts are combined with <br>
            NFTs more, I think it has a great potential to develop arts in more diverse ways
