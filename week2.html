            In “As We May Think,” Banniver Bush gives scientists directions for scientific developments in the future. <br>
            He pondered how to efficiently manage and use tons of information and data. Bush expected the emergence of a <br>
            device called “memex,” which uses a human thinking mechanism that links relevant informations or memories <br>
            in the head. The memex he describes is very similar to the "WWW" nowadays. Like a web database, data can be <br>
            collected and stored through memex. Just as he imagined memex, I noticed that deep thinking about the interaction <br>
            between human beings and machines is essential for students learning web development.
